# ESP-IDF Mesh Stack Application Framework & Practical Guide

The purpose of this program is to provide a comprehensive framework for developing applications using the Wi-Fi networking functionalities currently offered by the ESP-IDF Wi-Fi stack as of version 3.1, which are described in detail along with the framework architecture in the attached *ESP-IDF Wi-Fi Stack Practical Guide*.

The features offered by the application framework include:

* The possibility of customizing via the `menuconfig` utility most of the aspects of Wi-Fi networking on a device, from its Station and SoftAP base configurations to their MAC and IP addresses, to the power saving mode to use on the Station interface, and more.

* A detailed code documentation and runtime logging of the evolution of the applicationâ€™s execution.

* Three driver components provided as examples, which perform periodic logging of the configurations of the Wi-Fi Station and SoftAP interfaces.

* The possibility of easily adding other driver components by providing them with a flag in the Wi-Fi Event Group and by creating their tasks in the appropriate driver components starting functions (see page 35 of the guide and the *wifibasics_driver.c* file for an example).

Due to the continuation of my studies, I currently have no plans to maintain or update this framework or the related guide, even if feedbacks and comments are most appreciated.
